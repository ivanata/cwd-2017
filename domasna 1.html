		Confusion is a 1975 studio album by Nigerian Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti (pictured) and his band. It was arranged, composed, and produced by Kuti, who emphasized his African heritage and nationalism on the album. Confusion is a commentary on post-colonial Lagos and its lack of infrastructure and proper leadership. Kuti's pidgin English lyrics depict difficult conditions in the city, including frenetic, multilingual street markets and inextricable traffic jams at Lagos' major intersections. Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat album with an entirely instrumental first half featuring free form interplay between Kuti's electric piano and Tony Allen's percussion. It leads to an extended mid-tempo section with polyrhythms by Allen and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who follows with call-and-response vocal passages. Since the record's release by EMI, it has been praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album. (Full article...)
